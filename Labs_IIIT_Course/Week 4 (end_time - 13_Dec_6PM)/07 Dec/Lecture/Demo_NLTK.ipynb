too soon, we came aboard. a league from epidamnum had we sail'd, before the always wind-obeying deep gave any tragic instance of our harm: but longer did we not retain much hope; for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death; which though myself would gladly have embraced, yet the incessant weepings of my wife, weeping before for what she saw must come, and piteous plainings of the pretty babes, that mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear, forced me to seek delays for them and me. and this it was, for other means was none: the sailors sought for safety by our boat, and left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us: my wife, more careful for the latter-born, had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, such as seafaring men provide for storms; to him one of the other twins was bound, whilst i had been like heedful of the other: the children thus disposed, my wife and i, fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast; and floating straight, obedient to the stream, was carried towards corinth, as we thought. at length the sun, gazing upon the earth, dispersed those vapours that offended us; and by the benefit of his wished light, the seas wax'd calm, and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us, of corinth that, of epidaurus this: but ere they came,--o, let me say no more! gather the sequel by that went before.  duke solinus  nay, forward, old man; do not break off so; for we may pity, though not pardon thee.  aegeon  o, had the gods done so, i had not now worthily term'd them merciless to us! for, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, we were encounterd by a mighty rock; which being violently borne upon, our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; so that, in this unjust divorce of us, fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in, what to sorrow for. her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe, was carried with more speed before the wind; and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth, as we thought. at length, another ship had seized on us; and, knowing whom it was their hap to save, gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests; and would have reft the fishers of their prey, had not their bark been very slow of sail; and therefore homeward did they bend their course. thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss; that by misfortunes was my life prolong'd, to tell sad stories of my own mishaps.  duke solinus  and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, do me the favour to dilate at full what hath befall'n of them and thee till now.  aegeon  my youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother: and importuned me that his attendant--so his case was like, reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-- might bear him company in the quest of him: whom whilst i labour'd of a love to see, i hazarded the loss of whom i loved. five summers have i spent in furthest greece, roaming clean through the bounds of asia, and, coasting homeward, came to ephesus; hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men. but here must end the story of my life; and happy were i in my timely death, could all my travels warrant me they live.  duke solinus  hapless aegeon, whom the fates have mark'd to bear the extremity of dire mishap! now, trust me, were it not against our laws, against my crown, my oath, my dignity, which princes, would they, may not disannul, my soul would sue as advocate for thee. but, though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recall'd but to our honour's great disparagement, yet i will favour thee in what i can. therefore, merchant, i'll limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help: try all the friends thou hast in ephesus; beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, and live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die. gaoler, take him to thy custody.  gaoler  i will, my lord.  aegeon  hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend, but to procrastinate his lifeless end. exeunt  scene ii. the mart.  enter antipholus of syracuse, dromio of syracuse, and first merchant  first merchant  therefore give out you are of epidamnum, lest that your goods too soon be confiscate. this very day a syracusian merchant is apprehended for arrival here; and not being able to buy out his life according to the statute of the town, dies ere the weary sun set in the west. there is your money that i had to keep. antipholus  of syracuse  go bear it to the centaur, where we host, and stay there, dromio, till i come to thee. within this hour it will be dinner-time: till that, i'll view the manners of the town, peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings, and then return and sleep within mine inn, for with long travel i am stiff and weary. get thee away.  dromio of syracuse  many a man would take you at your word, and go indeed, having so good a mean. exit antipholus  of syracuse  a trusty villain, sir, that very oft, when i am dull with care and melancholy, lightens my humour with his merry jests. what, will you walk with me about the town, and then go to my inn and dine with me?  first merchant  i am invited, sir, to certain merchants, of whom i hope to make much benefit; i crave your pardon. soon at five o'clock, please you, i'll meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till bed-time: my present business calls me from you now. antipholus  of syracuse  farewell till then: i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city.  first merchant  sir, i commend you to your own content. exit antipholus  of syracuse  he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i cannot get. i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop, who, falling there to find his fellow forth, unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself: so i, to find a mother and a brother, in quest of them, unhappy, lose myself. enter dromio of ephesus here comes the almanac of my true date. what now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?  dromio of ephesus  return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late: the capon burns, the pig falls from the spit, the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell; my mistress made it one upon my cheek: she is so hot because the meat is cold; the meat is cold because you come not home; you come not home because you have no stomach; you have no stomach having broke your fast; but we that know what 'tis to fast and pray are penitent for your default to-day. antipholus  of syracuse  stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, i pray: where have you left the money that i gave you?  dromio of ephesus  o,--sixpence, that i had o' wednesday last to pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper? the saddler had it, sir; i kept it not. antipholus  of syracuse  i am not in a sportive humour now: tell me, and dally not, where is the money? we being strangers here, how darest thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody?  dromio of ephesus  i pray you, air, as you sit at dinner: i from my mistress come to you in post; if i return, i shall be post indeed, for she will score your fault upon my pate. methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock, and strike you home without a messenger. antipholus  of syracuse  come, dromio, come, these jests are out of season; reserve them till a merrier hour than this. where is the gold i gave in charge to thee?  dromio of ephesus  to me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me. antipholus  of syracuse  come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness, and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.  dromio of ephesus  my charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house, the phoenix, sir, to dinner: my mistress and her sister stays for you. antipholus  of syracuse  in what safe place you have bestow'd my money, or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed: where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?  dromio of ephesus  i have some marks of yours upon my pate, some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders, but not a thousand marks between you both. if i should pay your worship those again, perchance you will not bear them patiently. antipholus  of syracuse  thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?  dromio of ephesus  your worship's wife, my mistress at the phoenix; she that doth fast till you come home to dinner, and prays that you will hie you home to dinner. antipholus  of syracuse  what, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face, being forbid? there, take you that, sir knave.  dromio of ephesus  what mean you, sir? for god's sake, hold your hands! nay, and you will not, sir, i'll take my heels. exit antipholus  of syracuse  upon my life, by some device or other the villain is o'er-raught of all my money. they say this town is full of cozenage, as, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye, dark-working sorcerers that change the mind, soul-killing witches that deform the body, disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks, and many such-like liberties of sin: if it prove so, i will be gone the sooner. i'll to the centaur, to go seek this slave: i greatly fear my money is not safe. exit  act ii scene i. the house of antipholus of ephesus.  enter adriana and luciana  adriana  neither my husband nor the slave return'd, that in such haste i sent to seek his master! sure, luciana, it is two o'clock.  luciana  perhaps some merchant hath invited him, and from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner. good sister, let us dine and never fret: a man is master of his liberty: time is their master, and, when they see time, they'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.  adriana  why should their liberty than ours be more?  luciana  because their business still lies out o' door.  adriana  look, when i serve him so, he takes it ill.  luciana  o, know he is the bridle of your will.  adriana  there's none but asses will be bridled so.  luciana  why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe. there's nothing situate under heaven's eye but hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky: the beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls, are their males' subjects and at their controls: men, more divine, the masters of all these, lords of the wide world and wild watery seas, indued with intellectual sense and souls, of more preeminence than fish and fowls, are masters to their females, and their lords: then let your will attend on their accords.  adriana  this servitude makes you to keep unwed.  luciana  not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.  adriana  but, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.  luciana  ere i learn love, i'll practise to obey.  adriana  how if your husband start some other where?  luciana  till he come home again, i would forbear.  adriana  patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause; they can be meek that have no other cause. a wretched soul, bruised with adversity, we bid be quiet when we hear it cry; but were we burdened with like weight of pain, as much or more would we ourselves complain: so thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee, with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me, but, if thou live to see like right bereft, this fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.  luciana  well, i will marry one day, but to try. here comes your man; now is your husband nigh. enter dromio of ephesus  adriana  say, is your tardy master now at hand?  dromio of ephesus  nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears can witness.  adriana  say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?  dromio of ephesus  ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear: beshrew his hand, i scarce could understand it.  luciana  spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?  dromio of ephesus  nay, he struck so plainly, i could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce understand them.  adriana  but say, i prithee, is he coming home? it seems he hath great care to please his wife.  dromio of ephesus  why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.  adriana  horn-mad, thou villain!  dromio of ephesus  i mean not cuckold-mad; but, sure, he is stark mad. when i desired him to come home to dinner, he ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold: ''tis dinner-time,' quoth i; 'my gold!' quoth he; 'your meat doth burn,' quoth i; 'my gold!' quoth he: 'will you come home?' quoth i; 'my gold!' quoth he. 'where is the thousand marks i gave thee, villain?' 'the pig,' quoth i, 'is burn'd;' 'my gold!' quoth he: 'my mistress, sir' quoth i; 'hang up thy mistress! i know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'  luciana  quoth who?  dromio of ephesus  quoth my master: 'i know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.' so that my errand, due unto my tongue, i thank him, i bare home upon my shoulders; for, in conclusion, he did beat me there.  adriana  go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.  dromio of ephesus  go back again, and be new beaten home? for god's sake, send some other messenger.  adriana  back, slave, or i will break thy pate across.  dromio of ephesus  and he will bless that cross with other beating: between you i shall have a holy head.  adriana  hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.  dromio of ephesus  am i so round with you as you with me, that like a football you do spurn me thus? you spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither: if i last in this service, you must case me in leather. exit  luciana  fie, how impatience loureth in your face!  adriana  his company must do his minions grace, whilst i at home starve for a merry look. hath homely age the alluring beauty took from my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it: are my discourses dull? barren my wit? if voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd, unkindness blunts it more than marble hard: do their gay vestments his affections bait? that's not my fault: he's master of my state: what ruins are in me that can be found, by him not ruin'd? then is he the ground of my defeatures. my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair but, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale and feeds from home; poor i am but his stale.  luciana  self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!  adriana  unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense. i know his eye doth homage otherwhere, or else what lets it but he would be here? sister, you know he promised me a chain; would that alone, alone he would detain, so he would keep fair quarter with his bed! i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still, that others touch, and often touching will wear gold: and no man that hath a name, by falsehood and corruption doth it shame. since that my beauty cannot please his eye, i'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.  luciana  how many fond fools serve mad jealousy! exeunt  scene ii. a public place.  enter antipholus of syracuse   antipholus  of syracuse  the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur; and the heedful slave is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out by computation and mine host's report. i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart. see, here he comes. enter dromio of syracuse how now sir! is your merry humour alter'd? as you love strokes, so jest with me again. you know no centaur? you received no gold? your mistress sent to have me home to dinner? my house was at the phoenix? wast thou mad, that thus so madly thou didst answer me?  dromio of syracuse  what answer, sir? when spake i such a word? antipholus  of syracuse  even now, even here, not half an hour since.  dromio of syracuse  i did not see you since you sent me hence, home to the centaur, with the gold you gave me. antipholus  of syracuse  villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt, and told'st me of a mistress and a dinner; for which, i hope, thou felt'st i was displeased.  dromio of syracuse  i am glad to see you in this merry vein: what means this jest? i pray you, master, tell me. antipholus  of syracuse  yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth? think'st thou i jest? hold, take thou that, and that. beating him  dromio of syracuse  hold, sir, for god's sake! now your jest is earnest: upon what bargain do you give it me? antipholus  of syracuse  because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you, your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours. when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport, but creep in crannies when he hides his beams. if you will jest with me, know my aspect, and fashion your demeanor to my looks, or i will beat this method in your sconce.  dromio of syracuse  sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, i had rather have it a head: an you use these blows long, i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too; or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders. but, i pray, sir why am i beaten? antipholus  of syracuse  dost thou not know?  dromio of syracuse  nothing, sir, but that i am beaten. antipholus  of syracuse  shall i tell you why?  dromio of syracuse  ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath a wherefore. antipholus  of syracuse  why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore-- for urging it the second time to me.  dromio of syracuse  was there ever any man thus beaten out of season, when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason? well, sir, i thank you. antipholus  of syracuse  thank me, sir, for what?  dromio of syracuse  marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing. antipholus  of syracuse  i'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for something. but say, sir, is it dinner-time?  dromio of syracuse  no, sir; i think the meat wants that i have. antipholus  of syracuse  in good time, sir; what's that?  dromio of syracuse  basting. antipholus  of syracuse  well, sir, then 'twill be dry.  dromio of syracuse  if it be, sir, i pray you, eat none of it. antipholus  of syracuse  your reason?  dromio of syracuse  lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting. antipholus  of syracuse  well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a time for all things.  dromio of syracuse  i durst have denied that, before you were so choleric. antipholus  of syracuse  by what rule, sir?  dromio of syracuse  marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself. antipholus  of syracuse  let's hear it.  dromio of syracuse  there's no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature. antipholus  of syracuse  may he not do it by fine and recovery?  dromio of syracuse  yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man. antipholus  of syracuse  why is time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?  dromio of syracuse  because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts; and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit. antipholus  of syracuse  why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.  dromio of syracuse  not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair. antipholus  of syracuse  why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.  dromio of syracuse  the plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity. antipholus  of syracuse  for what reason?  dromio of syracuse  for two; and sound ones too. antipholus  of syracuse  nay, not sound, i pray you.  dromio of syracuse  sure ones, then. antipholus  of syracuse  nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.  dromio of syracuse  certain ones then. antipholus  of syracuse  name them.  dromio of syracuse  the one, to save the money that he spends in trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge. antipholus  of syracuse  you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.  dromio of syracuse  marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair lost by nature. antipholus  of syracuse  but your reason was not substantial, why there is no time to recover.  dromio of syracuse  thus i mend it: time himself is bald and therefore to the world's end will have bald followers. antipholus  of syracuse  i knew 'twould be a bald conclusion: but, soft! who wafts us yonder? enter adriana and luciana  adriana  ay, ay, antipholus, look strange and frown: some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects; i am not adriana nor thy wife. the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear, that never object pleasing in thine eye, that never touch well welcome to thy hand, that never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste, unless i spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee. how comes it now, my husband, o, how comes it, that thou art thus estranged from thyself? thyself i call it, being strange to me, that, undividable, incorporate, am better than thy dear self's better part. ah, do not tear away thyself from me! for know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf, and take unmingled that same drop again, without addition or diminishing, as take from me thyself and not me too. how dearly would it touch me to the quick, shouldst thou but hear i were licentious and that this body, consecrate to thee, by ruffian lust should be contaminate! wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me and hurl the name of husband in my face and tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow and from my false hand cut the wedding-ring and break it with a deep-divorcing vow? i know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it. i am possess'd with an adulterate blot; my blood is mingled with the crime of lust: for if we too be one and thou play false, i do digest the poison of thy flesh, being strumpeted by thy contagion. keep then far league and truce with thy true bed; i live unstain'd, thou undishonoured. antipholus  of syracuse  plead you to me, fair dame? i know you not: in ephesus i am but two hours old, as strange unto your town as to your talk; who, every word by all my wit being scann'd, want wit in all one word to understand.  luciana  fie, brother! how the world is changed with you! when were you wont to use my sister thus? she sent for you by dromio home to dinner. antipholus  of syracuse  by dromio?  dromio of syracuse  by me?  adriana  by thee; and this thou didst return from him, that he did buffet thee, and, in his blows, denied my house for his, me for his wife. antipholus  of syracuse  did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman? what is the course and drift of your compact?  dromio of syracuse  i, sir? i never saw her till this time. antipholus  of syracuse  villain, thou liest; for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart.  dromio of syracuse  i never spake with her in all my life. antipholus  of syracuse  how can she thus then call us by our names, unless it be by inspiration.  adriana  how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave, abetting him to thwart me in my mood! be it my wrong you are from me exempt, but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt. come, i will fasten on this sleeve of thine: thou art an elm, my husband, i a vine, whose weakness, married to thy stronger state, makes me with thy strength to communicate: if aught possess thee from me, it is dross, usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss; who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion infect thy sap and live on thy confusion. antipholus  of syracuse  to me she speaks; she moves me for her theme: what, was i married to her in my dream? or sleep i now and think i hear all this? what error drives our eyes and ears amiss? until i know this sure uncertainty, i'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.  luciana  dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.  dromio of syracuse  o, for my beads! i cross me for a sinner. this is the fairy land: o spite of spites! we talk with goblins, owls and sprites: if we obey them not, this will ensue, they'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.  luciana  why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not? dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!  dromio of syracuse  i am transformed, master, am i not? antipholus  of syracuse  i think thou art in mind, and so am i.  dromio of syracuse  nay, master, both in mind and in my shape. antipholus  of syracuse  thou hast thine own form.  dromio of syracuse  no, i am an ape.  luciana  if thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.  dromio of syracuse  'tis true; she rides me and i long for grass. 'tis so, i am an ass; else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me.  adriana  come, come, no longer will i be a fool, to put the finger in the eye and weep, whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn. come, sir, to dinner. dromio, keep the gate. husband, i'll dine above with you to-day and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks. sirrah, if any ask you for your master, say he dines forth, and let no creature enter. come, sister. dromio, play the porter well. antipholus  of syracuse  am i in earth, in heaven, or in hell? sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised? known unto these, and to myself disguised! i'll say as they say and persever so, and in this mist at all adventures go.  dromio of syracuse  master, shall i be porter at the gate?  adriana  ay; and let none enter, lest i break your pate.  luciana  come, come, antipholus, we dine too late. exeunt  act iii scene i. before the house of antipholus of ephesus.  enter antipholus of ephesus, dromio of ephesus, angelo, and balthazar   antipholus  of ephesus  good signior angelo, you must excuse us all; my wife is shrewish when i keep not hours: say that i linger'd with you at your shop to see the making of her carcanet, and that to-morrow you will bring it home. but here's a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart, and that i beat him, and charged him with a thousand marks in gold, and that i did deny my wife and house. thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?  dromio of ephesus  say what you will, sir, but i know what i know; that you beat me at the mart, i have your hand to show: if the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink, your own handwriting would tell you what i think. antipholus  of ephesus  i think thou art an ass.  dromio of ephesus  marry, so it doth appear by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear. i should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass, you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass. antipholus  of ephesus  you're sad, signior balthazar: pray god our cheer may answer my good will and your good welcome here.  balthazar  i hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome dear. antipholus  of ephesus  o, signior balthazar, either at flesh or fish, a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.  balthazar  good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords. antipholus  of ephesus  and welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.  balthazar  small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast. antipholus  of ephesus  ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest: but though my cates be mean, take them in good part; better cheer may you have, but not with better heart. but, soft! my door is lock'd. go bid them let us in.  dromio of ephesus  maud, bridget, marian, cicel, gillian, ginn!  dromio of syracuse  [within]  mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb, idiot, patch! either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch. dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st for such store, when one is one too many? go, get thee from the door.  dromio of ephesus  what patch is made our porter? my master stays in the street.  dromio of syracuse  [within]  let him walk from whence he came, lest he catch cold on's feet. antipholus  of ephesus  who talks within there? ho, open the door!  dromio of syracuse  [within]  right, sir; i'll tell you when, an you tell me wherefore. antipholus  of ephesus  wherefore? for my dinner: i have not dined to-day.  dromio of syracuse  [within]  nor to-day here you must not; come again when you may. antipholus  of ephesus  what art thou that keepest me out from the house i owe?  dromio of syracuse  [within]  the porter for this time, sir, and my name is dromio.  dromio of ephesus  o villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name. the one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame. if thou hadst been dromio to-day in my place, thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy name for an ass.  luce  [within]  what a coil is there, dromio? who are those at the gate?  dromio of ephesus  let my master in, luce.  luce  [within]  faith, no; he comes too late; and so tell your master.  dromio of ephesus  o lord, i must laugh! have at you with a proverb--shall i set in my staff?  luce  [within]  have at you with another; that's--when? can you tell?  dromio of syracuse  [within]  if thy name be call'd luce--luce, thou hast answered him well.  antipholus  do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, i hope? of ephesus  luce  [within]  i thought to have asked you.  dromio of syracuse  [within]  and you said no.  dromio of ephesus  so, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow. antipholus  of ephesus  thou baggage, let me in.  luce  [within]  can you tell for whose sake?  dromio of ephesus  master, knock the door hard.  luce  [within]  let him knock till it ache. antipholus  of ephesus  you'll cry for this, minion, if i beat the door down.  luce  [within]  what needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?  adriana  [within]  who is that at the door that keeps all this noise?  dromio of syracuse  [within]  by my troth, your town is troubled with unruly boys. antipholus  of ephesus  are you there, wife? you might have come before.  adriana  [within]  your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.  dromio of ephesus  if you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.  angelo  here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would fain have either.  balthazar  in debating which was best, we shall part with neither.  dromio of ephesus  they stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither. antipholus  of ephesus  there is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.  dromio of ephesus  you would say so, master, if your garments were thin. your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold: it would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold. antipholus  of ephesus  go fetch me something: i'll break ope the gate.  dromio of syracuse  [within]  break any breaking here, and i'll break your knave's pate.  dromio of ephesus  a man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind, ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.  dromio of syracuse  [within]  it seems thou want'st breaking: out upon thee, hind!  dromio of ephesus  here's too much 'out upon thee!' i pray thee, let me in.  dromio of syracuse  [within]  ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin. antipholus  of ephesus  well, i'll break in: go borrow me a crow.  dromio of ephesus  a crow without feather? master, mean you so? for a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather; if a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together. antipholus  of ephesus  go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.  balthazar  have patience, sir; o, let it not be so! herein you war against your reputation and draw within the compass of suspect the unviolated honour of your wife. once this,--your long experience of her wisdom, her sober virtue, years and modesty, plead on her part some cause to you unknown: and doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you. be ruled by me: depart in patience, and let us to the tiger all to dinner, and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint. if by strong hand you offer to break in now in the stirring passage of the day, a vulgar comment will be made of it, and that supposed by the common rout against your yet ungalled estimation that may with foul intrusion enter in and dwell upon your grave when you are dead; for slander lives upon succession, for ever housed where it gets possession. antipholus  of ephesus  you have prevailed: i will depart in quiet, and, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry. i know a wench of excellent discourse, pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle: there will we dine. this woman that i mean, my wife--but, i protest, without desert-- hath oftentimes upbraided me withal: to her will we to dinner. to angelo get you home and fetch the chain; by this i know 'tis made: bring it, i pray you, to the porpentine; for there's the house: that chain will i bestow-- be it for nothing but to spite my wife-- upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste. since mine own doors refuse to entertain me, i'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.  angelo  i'll meet you at that place some hour hence. antipholus  of ephesus  do so. this jest shall cost me some expense. exeunt  scene ii. the same.  enter luciana and antipholus of syracuse  luciana  and may it be that you have quite forgot a husband's office? shall, antipholus. even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot? shall love, in building, grow so ruinous? if you did wed my sister for her wealth, then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness: or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth; muffle your false love with some show of blindness: let not my sister read it in your eye; be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator; look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty; apparel vice like virtue's harbinger; bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted; teach sin the carriage of a holy saint; be secret-false: what need she be acquainted? what simple thief brags of his own attaint? 'tis double wrong, to truant with your bed and let her read it in thy looks at board: shame hath a bastard fame, well managed; ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word. alas, poor women! make us but believe, being compact of credit, that you love us; though others have the arm, show us the sleeve; we in your motion turn and you may move us. then, gentle brother, get you in again; comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife: 'tis holy sport to be a little vain, when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife. antipholus  of syracuse  sweet mistress--what your name is else, i know not, nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,-- less in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine. teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak; lay open to my earthy-gross conceit, smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak, the folded meaning of your words' deceit. against my soul's pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field? are you a god? would you create me new? transform me then, and to your power i'll yield. but if that i am i, then well i know your weeping sister is no wife of mine, nor to her bed no homage do i owe far more, far more to you do i decline. o, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note, to drown me in thy sister's flood of tears: sing, siren, for thyself and i will dote: spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs, and as a bed i'll take them and there lie, and in that glorious supposition think he gains by death that hath such means to die: let love, being light, be drowned if she sink!  luciana  what, are you mad, that you do reason so? antipholus  of syracuse  not mad, but mated; how, i do not know.  luciana  it is a fault that springeth from your eye. antipholus  of syracuse  for gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.  luciana  gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight. antipholus  of syracuse  as good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.  luciana  why call you me love? call my sister so. antipholus  of syracuse  thy sister's sister.  luciana  that's my sister. antipholus  of syracuse  no; it is thyself, mine own self's better part, mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart, my food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim, my sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.  luciana  all this my sister is, or else should be. antipholus  of syracuse  call thyself sister, sweet, for i am thee. thee will i love and with thee lead my life: thou hast no husband yet nor i no wife. give me thy hand.  luciana                    o, soft, air! hold you still: i'll fetch my sister, to get her good will. exit enter dromio of syracuse antipholus  of syracuse  why, how now, dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?  dromio of syracuse  do you know me, sir? am i dromio? am i your man? am i myself? antipholus  of syracuse  thou art dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.  dromio of syracuse  i am an ass, i am a woman's man and besides myself.  antipholus  what woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?  dromio of syracuse  marry, sir, besides myself, i am due to a woman; one that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me. antipholus  of syracuse  what claim lays she to thee?  dromio of syracuse  marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, i being a beast, she would have me; but that she, being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me. antipholus  of syracuse  what is she?  dromio of syracuse  a very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may not speak of without he say 'sir-reverence.' i have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage. antipholus  of syracuse  how dost thou mean a fat marriage?  dromio of syracuse  marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease; and i know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light. i warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a poland winter: if she lives till doomsday, she'll burn a week longer than the whole world. antipholus  of syracuse  what complexion is she of?  dromio of syracuse  swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over shoes in the grime of it. antipholus  of syracuse  that's a fault that water will mend.  dromio of syracuse  no, sir, 'tis in grain; noah's flood could not do it. antipholus  of syracuse  what's her name?  dromio of syracuse  nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from hip to hip. antipholus  of syracuse  then she bears some breadth?  dromio of syracuse  no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; i could find out countries in her. antipholus  of syracuse  in what part of her body stands ireland?  dromio of syracuse  marry, in her buttocks: i found it out by the bogs. antipholus  of syracuse  where scotland?  dromio of syracuse  i found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand. antipholus  of syracuse  where france?  dromio of syracuse  in her forehead; armed and reverted, making war against her heir. antipholus  of syracuse  where england?  dromio of syracuse  i looked for the chalky cliffs, but i could find no whiteness in them; but i guess it stood in her chin, by the salt rheum that ran between france and it. antipholus  of syracuse  where spain?  dromio of syracuse  faith, i saw it not; but i felt it hot in her breath. antipholus  of syracuse  where america, the indies?  dromio of syracuse  oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose. antipholus  of syracuse  where stood belgia, the netherlands?  dromio of syracuse  oh, sir, i did not look so low. to conclude, this drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me dromio; swore i was assured to her; told me what privy marks i had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that i amazed ran from her as a witch: and, i think, if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel, she had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made me turn i' the wheel. antipholus  of syracuse  go hie thee presently, post to the road: an if the wind blow any way from shore, i will not harbour in this town to-night: if any bark put forth, come to the mart, where i will walk till thou return to me. if every one knows us and we know none, 'tis time, i think, to trudge, pack and be gone.  dromio of syracuse  as from a bear a man would run for life, so fly i from her that would be my wife. exit antipholus  of syracuse  there's none but witches do inhabit here; and therefore 'tis high time that i were hence. she that doth call me husband, even my soul doth for a wife abhor. but her fair sister, possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace, of such enchanting presence and discourse, hath almost made me traitor to myself: but, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong, i'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song. enter angelo with the chain  angelo  master antipholus,-- antipholus  of syracuse  ay, that's my name.  angelo  i know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain. i thought to have ta'en you at the porpentine: the chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long. antipholus  of syracuse  what is your will that i shall do with this?  angelo  what please yourself, sir: i have made it for you. antipholus  of syracuse  made it for me, sir! i bespoke it not.  angelo  not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have. go home with it and please your wife withal; and soon at supper-time i'll visit you and then receive my money for the chain. antipholus  of syracuse  i pray you, sir, receive the money now, for fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.  angelo  you are a merry man, sir: fare you well. exit antipholus  of syracuse  what i should think of this, i cannot tell: but this i think, there's no man is so vain that would refuse so fair an offer'd chain. i see a man here needs not live by shifts, when in the streets he meets such golden gifts. i'll to the mart, and there for dromio stay if any ship put out, then straight away. exit  act iv scene i. a public place.  enter second merchant, angelo, and an officer  second merchant  you know since pentecost the sum is due, and since i have not much importuned you; nor now i had not, but that i am bound to persia, and want guilders for my voyage: therefore make present satisfaction, or i'll attach you by this officer.  angelo  even just the sum that i do owe to you is growing to me by antipholus, and in the instant that i met with you he had of me a chain: at five o'clock i shall receive the money for the same. pleaseth you walk with me down to his house, i will discharge my bond and thank you too. enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus from the courtezan's  officer  that labour may you save: see where he comes. antipholus  of ephesus  while i go to the goldsmith's house, go thou and buy a rope's end: that will i bestow among my wife and her confederates, for locking me out of my doors by day. but, soft! i see the goldsmith. get thee gone; buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.  dromio of ephesus  i buy a thousand pound a year: i buy a rope. exit antipholus  of ephesus  a man is well holp up that trusts to you: i promised your presence and the chain; but neither chain nor goldsmith came to me. belike you thought our love would last too long, if it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.  angelo  saving your merry humour, here's the note how much your chain weighs to the utmost carat, the fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion. which doth amount to three odd ducats more than i stand debted to this gentleman: i pray you, see him presently discharged, for he is bound to sea and stays but for it. antipholus  of ephesus  i am not furnish'd with the present money; besides, i have some business in the town. good signior, take the stranger to my house and with you take the chain and bid my wife disburse the sum on the receipt thereof: perchance i will be there as soon as you.  angelo  then you will bring the chain to her yourself? antipholus  of ephesus  no; bear it with you, lest i come not time enough.  angelo  well, sir, i will. have you the chain about you? antipholus  of ephesus  an if i have not, sir, i hope you have; or else you may return without your money.  angelo  nay, come, i pray you, sir, give me the chain: both wind and tide stays for this gentleman, and i, to blame, have held him here too long. antipholus  of ephesus  good lord! you use this dalliance to excuse your breach of promise to the porpentine. i should have chid you for not bringing it, but, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.  second merchant  the hour steals on; i pray you, sir, dispatch.  angelo  you hear how he importunes me;--the chain! antipholus  of ephesus  why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.  angelo  come, come, you know i gave it you even now. either send the chain or send me by some token. antipholus  of ephesus  fie, now you run this humour out of breath, where's the chain? i pray you, let me see it.  second merchant  my business cannot brook this dalliance. good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no: if not, i'll leave him to the officer. antipholus  of ephesus  i answer you! what should i answer you?  angelo  the money that you owe me for the chain. antipholus  of ephesus  i owe you none till i receive the chain.  angelo  you know i gave it you half an hour since. antipholus  of ephesus  you gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.  angelo  you wrong me more, sir, in denying it: consider how it stands upon my credit.  second merchant  well, officer, arrest him at my suit.  officer  i do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.  angelo  this touches me in reputation. either consent to pay this sum for me or i attach you by this officer. antipholus  of ephesus  consent to pay thee that i never had! arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.  angelo  here is thy fee; arrest him, officer, i would not spare my brother in this case, if he should scorn me so apparently.  officer  i do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit. antipholus  of ephesus  i do obey thee till i give thee bail. but, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear as all the metal in your shop will answer.  angelo  sir, sir, i will have law in ephesus, to your notorious shame; i doubt it not. enter dromio of syracuse, from the bay  dromio of syracuse  master, there is a bark of epidamnum that stays but till her owner comes aboard, and then, sir, she bears away. our fraughtage, sir, i have convey'd aboard; and i have bought the oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae. the ship is in her trim; the merry wind blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all but for their owner, master, and yourself. antipholus  of ephesus  how now! a madman! why, thou peevish sheep, what ship of epidamnum stays for me?  dromio of syracuse  a ship you sent me to, to hire waftage. antipholus  of ephesus  thou drunken slave, i sent thee for a rope; and told thee to what purpose and what end.  dromio of syracuse  you sent me for a rope's end as soon: you sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark. antipholus  of ephesus  i will debate this matter at more leisure and teach your ears to list me with more heed. to adriana, villain, hie thee straight: give her this key, and tell her, in the desk that's cover'd o'er with turkish tapestry, there is a purse of ducats; let her send it: tell her i am arrested in the street and that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone! on, officer, to prison till it come. exeunt second merchant, angelo, officer, and antipholus of ephesus  dromio of syracuse  to adriana! that is where we dined, where dowsabel did claim me for her husband: she is too big, i hope, for me to compass. thither i must, although against my will, for servants must their masters' minds fulfil. exit  scene ii. the house of antipholus of ephesus.  enter adriana and luciana  adriana  ah, luciana, did he tempt thee so? mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye that he did plead in earnest? yea or no? look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily? what observation madest thou in this case of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?  luciana  first he denied you had in him no right.  adriana  he meant he did me none; the more my spite.  luciana  then swore he that he was a stranger here.  adriana  and true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.  luciana  then pleaded i for you.  adriana  and what said he?  luciana  that love i begg'd for you he begg'd of me.  adriana  with what persuasion did he tempt thy love?  luciana  with words that in an honest suit might move. first he did praise my beauty, then my speech.  adriana  didst speak him fair?  luciana  have patience, i beseech.  adriana  i cannot, nor i will not, hold me still; my tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will. he is deformed, crooked, old and sere, ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere; vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind; stigmatical in making, worse in mind.  luciana  who would be jealous then of such a one? no evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.  adriana  ah, but i think him better than i say, and yet would herein others' eyes were worse. far from her nest the lapwing cries away: my heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse. enter dromio of syracuse  dromio of syracuse  here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.  luciana  how hast thou lost thy breath?  dromio of syracuse  by running fast.  adriana  where is thy master, dromio? is he well?  dromio of syracuse  no, he's in tartar limbo, worse than hell. a devil in an everlasting garment hath him; one whose hard heart is button'd up with steel; a fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough; a wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff; a back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands the passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands; a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well; one that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.  adriana  why, man, what is the matter?  dromio of syracuse  i do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.  adriana  what, is he arrested? tell me at whose suit.  dromio of syracuse  i know not at whose suit he is arrested well; but he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can i tell. will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?  adriana  go fetch it, sister. exit luciana this i wonder at, that he, unknown to me, should be in debt. tell me, was he arrested on a band?  dromio of syracuse  not on a band, but on a stronger thing; a chain, a chain! do you not hear it ring?  adriana  what, the chain?  dromio of syracuse  no, no, the bell: 'tis time that i were gone: it was two ere i left him, and now the clock strikes one.  adriana  the hours come back! that did i never hear.  dromio of syracuse  o, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for very fear.  adriana  as if time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!  dromio of syracuse  time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's worth, to season. nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say that time comes stealing on by night and day? if time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way, hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day? re-enter luciana with a purse  adriana  go, dromio; there's the money, bear it straight; and bring thy master home immediately. come, sister: i am press'd down with conceit-- conceit, my comfort and my injury. exeunt  scene iii. a public place.  enter antipholus of syracuse   antipholus  of syracuse  there's not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their well-acquainted friend; and every one doth call me by my name. some tender money to me; some invite me; some other give me thanks for kindnesses; some offer me commodities to buy: even now a tailor call'd me in his shop and show'd me silks that he had bought for me, and therewithal took measure of my body. sure, these are but imaginary wiles and lapland sorcerers inhabit here. enter dromio of syracuse  dromio of syracuse  master, here's the gold you sent me for. what, have you got the picture of old adam new-apparelled? antipholus  of syracuse  what gold is this? what adam dost thou mean?  dromio of syracuse  not that adam that kept the paradise but that adam that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's skin that was killed for the prodigal; he that came behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty. antipholus  of syracuse  i understand thee not.  dromio of syracuse  no? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir, that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a morris-pike. antipholus  of syracuse  what, thou meanest an officer?  dromio of syracuse  ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'god give you good rest!' antipholus  of syracuse  well, sir, there rest in your foolery. is there any  dromio of syracuse  why, sir, i brought you word an hour since that the bark expedition put forth to-night; and then were you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy delay. here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you. antipholus  of syracuse  the fellow is distract, and so am i; and here we wander in illusions: some blessed power deliver us from hence! enter a courtezan  courtezan  well met, well met, master antipholus. i see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now: is that the chain you promised me to-day? antipholus  of syracuse  satan, avoid! i charge thee, tempt me not.  dromio of syracuse  master, is this mistress satan? antipholus  of syracuse  it is the devil.  dromio of syracuse  nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof comes that the wenches say 'god damn me;' that's as much to say 'god make me a light wench.' it is written, they appear to men like angels of light: light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn. come not near her.  courtezan  your man and you are marvellous merry, sir. will you go with me? we'll mend our dinner here?  dromio of syracuse  master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a long spoon. antipholus  of syracuse  why, dromio?  dromio of syracuse  marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil. antipholus  of syracuse  avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping? thou art, as you are all, a sorceress: i conjure thee to leave me and be gone.  courtezan  give me the ring of mine you had at dinner, or, for my diamond, the chain you promised, and i'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.  dromio of syracuse  some devils ask but the parings of one's nail, a rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin, a nut, a cherry-stone; but she, more covetous, would have a chain. master, be wise: an if you give it her, the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.  courtezan  i pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain: i hope you do not mean to cheat me so. antipholus  of syracuse  avaunt, thou witch! come, dromio, let us go.  dromio of syracuse  'fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know. exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse  courtezan  now, out of doubt antipholus is mad, else would he never so demean himself. a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats, and for the same he promised me a chain: both one and other he denies me now. the reason that i gather he is mad, besides this present instance of his rage, is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner, of his own doors being shut against his entrance. belike his wife, acquainted with his fits, on purpose shut the doors against his way. my way is now to hie home to his house, and tell his wife that, being lunatic, he rush'd into my house and took perforce my ring away. this course i fittest choose; for forty ducats is too much to lose. exit  scene iv. a street.  enter antipholus of ephesus and the officer   antipholus  of ephesus  fear me not, man; i will not break away: i'll give thee, ere i leave thee, so much money, to warrant thee, as i am 'rested for. my wife is in a wayward mood to-day, and will not lightly trust the messenger that i should be attach'd in ephesus, i tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears. enter dromio of ephesus with a rope's-end here comes my man; i think he brings the money. how now, sir! have you that i sent you for?  dromio of ephesus  here's that, i warrant you, will pay them all. antipholus  of ephesus  but where's the money?  dromio of ephesus  why, sir, i gave the money for the rope. antipholus  of ephesus  five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?  dromio of ephesus  i'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate. antipholus  of ephesus  to what end did i bid thee hie thee home?  dromio of ephesus  to a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am i returned. antipholus  of ephesus  and to that end, sir, i will welcome you. beating him  officer  good sir, be patient.  dromio of ephesus  nay, 'tis for me to be patient; i am in adversity.  officer  good, now, hold thy tongue.  dromio of ephesus  nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands. antipholus  of ephesus  thou whoreson, senseless villain!  dromio of ephesus  i would i were senseless, sir, that i might not feel your blows.  antipholus  thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an ass.  dromio of ephesus  i am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long ears. i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows. when i am cold, he heats me with beating; when i am warm, he cools me with beating; i am waked with it when i sleep; raised with it when i sit; driven out of doors with it when i go from home; welcomed home with it when i return; nay, i bear it on my shoulders, as a beggar wont her brat; and, i think when he hath lamed me, i shall beg with it from door to door. antipholus  of ephesus  come, go along; my wife is coming yonder. enter adriana, luciana, the courtezan, and pinch  dromio of ephesus  mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the rope's-end.' antipholus  of ephesus  wilt thou still talk? beating him  courtezan  how say you now? is not your husband mad?  adriana  his incivility confirms no less. good doctor pinch, you are a conjurer; establish him in his true sense again, and i will please you what you will demand.  luciana  alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!  courtezan  mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!  pinch  give me your hand and let me feel your pulse. antipholus  of ephesus  there is my hand, and let it feel your ear. striking him  pinch  i charge thee, satan, housed within this man, to yield possession to my holy prayers and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight: i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven! antipholus  of ephesus  peace, doting wizard, peace! i am not mad.  adriana  o, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul! antipholus  of ephesus  you minion, you, are these your customers? did this companion with the saffron face revel and feast it at my house to-day, whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house?  adriana  o husband, god doth know you dined at home; where would you had remain'd until this time, free from these slanders and this open shame! antipholus  of ephesus  dined at home! thou villain, what sayest thou?  dromio of ephesus  sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home. antipholus  of ephesus  were not my doors lock'd up and i shut out?  dromio of ephesus  perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out. antipholus  of ephesus  and did not she herself revile me there?  dromio of ephesus  sans fable, she herself reviled you there. antipholus  of ephesus  did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?  dromio of ephesus  certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you. antipholus  of ephesus  and did not i in rage depart from thence?  dromio of ephesus  in verity you did; my bones bear witness, that since have felt the vigour of his rage.  adriana  is't good to soothe him in these contraries?  pinch  it is no shame: the fellow finds his vein, and yielding to him humours well his frenzy. antipholus  of ephesus  thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.  adriana  alas, i sent you money to redeem you, by dromio here, who came in haste for it.  dromio of ephesus  money by me! heart and goodwill you might; but surely master, not a rag of money. antipholus  of ephesus  went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?  adriana  he came to me and i deliver'd it.  luciana  and i am witness with her that she did.  dromio of ephesus  god and the rope-maker bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope!  pinch  mistress, both man and master is possess'd; i know it by their pale and deadly looks: they must be bound and laid in some dark room. antipholus  of ephesus  say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day? and why dost thou deny the bag of gold?  adriana  i did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.  dromio of ephesus  and, gentle master, i received no gold; but i confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.  adriana  dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both. antipholus  of ephesus  dissembling harlot, thou art false in all; and art confederate with a damned pack to make a loathsome abject scorn of me: but with these nails i'll pluck out these false eyes that would behold in me this shameful sport. enter three or four, and offer to bind him. he strives  adriana  o, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.  pinch  more company! the fiend is strong within him.  luciana  ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks! antipholus  of ephesus  what, will you murder me? thou gaoler, thou, i am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them to make a rescue?  officer                    masters, let him go he is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.  pinch  go bind this man, for he is frantic too. they offer to bind dromio of ephesus  adriana  what wilt thou do, thou peevish officer? hast thou delight to see a wretched man do outrage and displeasure to himself?  officer  he is my prisoner: if i let him go, the debt he owes will be required of me.  adriana  i will discharge thee ere i go from thee: bear me forthwith unto his creditor, and, knowing how the debt grows, i will pay it. good master doctor, see him safe convey'd home to my house. o most unhappy day! antipholus  of ephesus  o most unhappy strumpet!  dromio of ephesus  master, i am here entered in bond for you. antipholus  of ephesus  out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?  dromio of ephesus  will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master: cry 'the devil!'  luciana  god help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!  adriana  go bear him hence. sister, go you with me. exeunt all but adriana, luciana, officer and courtezan say now, whose suit is he arrested at?  officer  one angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?  adriana  i know the man. what is the sum he owes?  officer  two hundred ducats.  adriana  say, how grows it due?  officer  due for a chain your husband had of him.  adriana  he did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.  courtezan  when as your husband all in rage to-day came to my house and took away my ring-- the ring i saw upon his finger now-- straight after did i meet him with a chain.  adriana  it may be so, but i did never see it. come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is: i long to know the truth hereof at large. enter antipholus of syracuse with his rapier drawn, and dromio of syracuse  luciana  god, for thy mercy! they are loose again.  adriana  and come with naked swords. let's call more help to have them bound again.  officer  away! they'll kill us. exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse antipholus  of syracuse  i see these witches are afraid of swords.  dromio of syracuse  she that would be your wife now ran from you. antipholus  of syracuse  come to the centaur; fetch our stuff from thence: i long that we were safe and sound aboard.  dromio of syracuse  faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold: methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me, i could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch. antipholus  of syracuse  i will not stay to-night for all the town; therefore away, to get our stuff aboard. exeunt  act v scene i. a street before a priory.  enter second merchant and angelo  angelo  i am sorry, sir, that i have hinder'd you; but, i protest, he had the chain of me, though most dishonestly he doth deny it.  second merchant  how is the man esteemed here in the city?  angelo  of very reverend reputation, sir, of credit infinite, highly beloved, second to none that lives here in the city: his word might bear my wealth at any time.  second merchant  speak softly; yonder, as i think, he walks. enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse  angelo  'tis so; and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have. good sir, draw near to me, i'll speak to him. signior antipholus, i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble; and, not without some scandal to yourself, with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly: beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, you have done wrong to this my honest friend, who, but for staying on our controversy, had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day: this chain you had of me; can you deny it? antipholus  of syracuse  i think i had; i never did deny it.  second merchant  yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too. antipholus  of syracuse  who heard me to deny it or forswear it?  second merchant  these ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee. fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest to walk where any honest man resort. antipholus  of syracuse  thou art a villain to impeach me thus: i'll prove mine honour and mine honesty against thee presently, if thou darest stand.  second merchant  i dare, and do defy thee for a villain. they draw enter adriana, luciana, the courtezan, and others  adriana  hold, hurt him not, for god's sake! he is mad. some get within him, take his sword away: bind dromio too, and bear them to my house.  dromio of syracuse  run, master, run; for god's sake, take a house! this is some priory. in, or we are spoil'd! exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory enter the lady abbess, aemilia  aemelia  be quiet, people. wherefore throng you hither?  adriana  to fetch my poor distracted husband hence. let us come in, that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery.  angelo  i knew he was not in his perfect wits.  second merchant  i am sorry now that i did draw on him.  aemelia  how long hath this possession held the man?  adriana  this week he hath been heavy, sour, sad, and much different from the man he was; but till this afternoon his passion ne'er brake into extremity of rage.  aemelia  hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea? buried some dear friend? hath not else his eye stray'd his affection in unlawful love? a sin prevailing much in youthful men, who give their eyes the liberty of gazing. which of these sorrows is he subject to?  adriana  to none of these, except it be the last; namely, some love that drew him oft from home.  aemelia  you should for that have reprehended him.  adriana  why, so i did.  aemelia                    ay, but not rough enough.  adriana  as roughly as my modesty would let me.  aemelia  haply, in private.  adriana  and in assemblies too.  aemelia  ay, but not enough.  adriana  it was the copy of our conference: in bed he slept not for my urging it; at board he fed not for my urging it; alone, it was the subject of my theme; in company i often glanced it; still did i tell him it was vile and bad.  aemelia  and thereof came it that the man was mad. the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth. it seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing, and therefore comes it that his head is light. thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings: unquiet meals make ill digestions; thereof the raging fire of fever bred; and what's a fever but a fit of madness? thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls: sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy, kinsman to grim and comfortless despair, and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life? in food, in sport and life-preserving rest to be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast: the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits.  luciana  she never reprehended him but mildly, when he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly. why bear you these rebukes and answer not?  adriana  she did betray me to my own reproof. good people enter and lay hold on him.  aemelia  no, not a creature enters in my house.  adriana  then let your servants bring my husband forth.  aemelia  neither: he took this place for sanctuary, and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again, or lose my labour in assaying it.  adriana  i will attend my husband, be his nurse, diet his sickness, for it is my office, and will have no attorney but myself; and therefore let me have him home with me.  aemelia  be patient; for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have, with wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers, to make of him a formal man again: it is a branch and parcel of mine oath, a charitable duty of my order. therefore depart and leave him here with me.  adriana  i will not hence and leave my husband here: and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife.  aemelia  be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him. exit  luciana  complain unto the duke of this indignity.  adriana  come, go: i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess.  second merchant  by this, i think, the dial points at five: anon, i'm sure, the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale, the place of death and sorry execution, behind the ditches of the abbey here.  angelo  upon what cause?  second merchant  to see a reverend syracusian merchant, who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town, beheaded publicly for his offence.  angelo  see where they come: we will behold his death.  luciana  kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey. enter duke solinus, attended; aegeon bareheaded; with the headsman and other officers  duke solinus  yet once again proclaim it publicly, if any friend will pay the sum for him, he shall not die; so much we tender him.  adriana  justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!  duke solinus  she is a virtuous and a reverend lady: it cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.  adriana  may it please your grace, antipholus, my husband, whom i made lord of me and all i had, at your important letters,--this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him; that desperately he hurried through the street, with him his bondman, all as mad as he-- doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses, bearing thence rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like. once did i get him bound and sent him home, whilst to take order for the wrongs i went, that here and there his fury had committed. anon, i wot not by what strong escape, he broke from those that had the guard of him; and with his mad attendant and himself, each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords, met us again and madly bent on us, chased us away; till, raising of more aid, we came again to bind them. then they fled into this abbey, whither we pursued them: and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out, nor send him forth that we may bear him hence. therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.  duke solinus  long since thy husband served me in my wars, and i to thee engaged a prince's word, when thou didst make him master of thy bed, to do him all the grace and good i could. go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate and bid the lady abbess come to me. i will determine this before i stir. enter a servant  servant  o mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself! my master and his man are both broke loose, beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire; and ever, as it blazed, they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair: my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool, and sure, unless you send some present help, between them they will kill the conjurer.  adriana  peace, fool! thy master and his man are here, and that is false thou dost report to us.  servant  mistress, upon my life, i tell you true; i have not breathed almost since i did see it. he cries for you, and vows, if he can take you, to scorch your face and to disfigure you. cry within hark, hark! i hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!  duke solinus  come, stand by me; fear nothing. guard with halberds!  adriana  ay me, it is my husband! witness you, that he is borne about invisible: even now we housed him in the abbey here; and now he's there, past thought of human reason. enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus antipholus  of ephesus  justice, most gracious duke, o, grant me justice! even for the service that long since i did thee, when i bestrid thee in the wars and took deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood that then i lost for thee, now grant me justice.  aegeon  unless the fear of death doth make me dote, i see my son antipholus and dromio. antipholus  of ephesus  justice, sweet prince, against that woman there! she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife, that hath abused and dishonour'd me even in the strength and height of injury! beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me.  duke solinus  discover how, and thou shalt find me just. antipholus  of ephesus  this day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me, while she with harlots feasted in my house.  duke solinus  a grievous fault! say, woman, didst thou so?  adriana  no, my good lord: myself, he and my sister to-day did dine together. so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal!  luciana  ne'er may i look on day, nor sleep on night, but she tells to your highness simple truth!  angelo  o perjured woman! they are both forsworn: in this the madman justly chargeth them. antipholus  of ephesus  my liege, i am advised what i say, neither disturbed with the effect of wine, nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire, albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad. this woman lock'd me out this day from dinner: that goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her, could witness it, for he was with me then; who parted with me to go fetch a chain, promising to bring it to the porpentine, where balthazar and i did dine together. our dinner done, and he not coming thither, i went to seek him: in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman. there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain, which, god he knows, i saw not: for the which he did arrest me with an officer. i did obey, and sent my peasant home for certain ducats: he with none return'd then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house. by the way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more of vile confederates. along with them they brought one pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain, a mere anatomy, a mountebank, a threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller, a needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch, a dead-looking man: this pernicious slave, forsooth, took on him as a conjurer, and, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse, and with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me, cries out, i was possess'd. then all together they fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man, both bound together; till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder, i gain'd my freedom, and immediately ran hither to your grace; whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities.  angelo  my lord, in truth, thus far i witness with him, that he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.  duke solinus  but had he such a chain of thee or no?  angelo  he had, my lord: and when he ran in here, these people saw the chain about his neck.  second merchant  besides, i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart: and thereupon i drew my sword on you; and then you fled into this abbey here, from whence, i think, you are come by miracle. antipholus  of ephesus  i never came within these abbey-walls, nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me: i never saw the chain, so help me heaven! and this is false you burden me withal.  duke solinus  why, what an intricate impeach is this! i think you all have drunk of circe's cup. if here you housed him, here he would have been; if he were mad, he would not plead so coldly: you say he dined at home; the goldsmith here denies that saying. sirrah, what say you?  dromio of ephesus  sir, he dined with her there, at the porpentine.  courtezan  he did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring. antipholus  of ephesus  'tis true, my liege; this ring i had of her.  duke solinus  saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?  courtezan  as sure, my liege, as i do see your grace.  duke solinus  why, this is strange. go call the abbess hither. i think you are all mated or stark mad. exit one to abbess  aegeon  most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word: haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me.  duke solinus  speak freely, syracusian, what thou wilt.  aegeon  is not your name, sir, call'd antipholus? and is not that your bondman, dromio?  dromio of ephesus  within this hour i was his bondman sir, but he, i thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords: now am i dromio and his man unbound.  aegeon  i am sure you both of you remember me.  dromio of ephesus  ourselves we do remember, sir, by you; for lately we were bound, as you are now you are not pinch's patient, are you, sir?  aegeon  why look you strange on me? you know me well.  antipholus  i never saw you in my life till now.  aegeon  o, grief hath changed me since you saw me last, and careful hours with time's deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face: but tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice? antipholus  of ephesus  neither.  aegeon  dromio, nor thou?  dromio of ephesus                    no, trust me, sir, nor i.  aegeon  i am sure thou dost.  dromio of ephesus  ay, sir, but i am sure i do not; and whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.  aegeon  not know my voice! o time's extremity, hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years, that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares? though now this grained face of mine be hid in sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow, and all the conduits of my blood froze up, yet hath my night of life some memory, my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left, my dull deaf ears a little use to hear: all these old witnesses--i cannot err-- tell me thou art my son antipholus. antipholus  of ephesus  i never saw my father in my life.  aegeon  but seven years since, in syracusa, boy, thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son, thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery. antipholus  of ephesus  the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so i ne'er saw syracusa in my life.  duke solinus  i tell thee, syracusian, twenty years have i been patron to antipholus, during which time he ne'er saw syracusa: i see thy age and dangers make thee dote. re-enter aemilia, with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse  aemelia  most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd. all gather to see them  adriana  i see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.  duke solinus  one of these men is genius to the other; and so of these. which is the natural man, and which the spirit? who deciphers them?  dromio of syracuse  i, sir, am dromio; command him away.  dromio of ephesus  i, sir, am dromio; pray, let me stay. antipholus  of syracuse  aegeon art thou not? or else his ghost?  dromio of syracuse  o, my old master! who hath bound him here?  aemelia  whoever bound him, i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty. speak, old aegeon, if thou be'st the man that hadst a wife once call'd aemilia that bore thee at a burden two fair sons: o, if thou be'st the same aegeon, speak, and speak unto the same aemilia!  aegeon  if i dream not, thou art aemilia: if thou art she, tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft?  aemelia  by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio all were taken up; but by and by rude fishermen of corinth by force took dromio and my son from them and me they left with those of epidamnum. what then became of them i cannot tell i to this fortune that you see me in.  duke solinus  why, here begins his morning story right; these two antipholuses, these two so like, and these two dromios, one in semblance,-- besides her urging of her wreck at sea,-- these are the parents to these children, which accidentally are met together. antipholus, thou camest from corinth first? antipholus  of syracuse  no, sir, not i; i came from syracuse.  duke solinus  stay, stand apart; i know not which is which. antipholus  of ephesus  i came from corinth, my most gracious lord,--  dromio of ephesus  and i with him. antipholus  of ephesus  brought to this town by that most famous warrior, duke menaphon, your most renowned uncle.  adriana  which of you two did dine with me to-day? antipholus  of syracuse  i, gentle mistress.  adriana  and are not you my husband? antipholus  of ephesus  no; i say nay to that. antipholus  of syracuse  and so do i; yet did she call me so: and this fair gentlewoman, her sister here, did call me brother. to luciana what i told you then, i hope i shall have leisure to make good; if this be not a dream i see and hear.  angelo  that is the chain, sir, which you had of me. antipholus  of syracuse  i think it be, sir; i deny it not. antipholus  of ephesus  and you, sir, for this chain arrested me.  angelo  i think i did, sir; i deny it not.  adriana  i sent you money, sir, to be your bail, by dromio; but i think he brought it not.  dromio of ephesus  no, none by me. antipholus  of syracuse  this purse of ducats i received from you, and dromio, my man, did bring them me. i see we still did meet each other's man, and i was ta'en for him, and he for me, and thereupon these errors are arose. antipholus  of ephesus  these ducats pawn i for my father here.  duke solinus  it shall not need; thy father hath his life.  courtezan  sir, i must have that diamond from you. antipholus  of ephesus  there, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.  aemelia  renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes: and all that are assembled in this place, that by this sympathized one day's error have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company, and we shall make full satisfaction. thirty-three years have i but gone in travail of you, my sons; and till this present hour my heavy burden ne'er delivered. the duke, my husband and my children both, and you the calendars of their nativity, go to a gossips' feast and go with me; after so long grief, such festivity!  duke solinus  with all my heart, i'll gossip at this feast. exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse, antipholus of ephesus, dromio of syracuse and dromio of ephesus  dromio of syracuse  master, shall i fetch your stuff from shipboard? antipholus  of ephesus  dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?  dromio of syracuse  your goods that lay at host, sir, in the centaur. antipholus  of syracuse  he speaks to me. i am your master, dromio: come, go with us; we'll look to that anon: embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him. exeunt antipholus of syracuse and antipholus of ephesus  dromio of syracuse  there is a fat friend at your master's house, that kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner: she now shall be my sister, not my wife.  dromio of ephesus  methinks you are my glass, and not my brother: i see by you i am a sweet-faced youth. will you walk in to see their gossiping?  dromio of syracuse  not i, sir; you are my elder.  dromio of ephesus  that's a question: how shall we try it?  dromio of syracuse  we'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.  dromio of ephesus  nay, then, thus: we came into the world like brother and brother; and now let's go hand in hand, not one before another. exeunt   \n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"GdOS0uHlFWNV"},"source":["### Tokenization\n","\n","Tokenization is a way to split the text into tokens.
