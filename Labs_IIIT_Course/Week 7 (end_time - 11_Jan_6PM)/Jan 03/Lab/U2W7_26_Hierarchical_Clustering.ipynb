This algorithm starts with all the data points assigned to a cluster of their own. Then two nearest clusters are merged into the same cluster. In the end, this algorithm terminates when there is only a single cluster left.\n","\n","Why Hierarchical Clustering is used over K-means Clustering Algorithm? K-means works well when the shape of clusters are hyper-spherical  (or circular in 2 dimensions). If there are general clusters occurring in the dataset which are non-spherical then probably K-means is not a good choice.\n","\n","K-means starts with random choice of cluster centers and it may lead to different clustering results and different runs of algorithm is required. Thus, the results may not be repeatable and lack of consistency with hierarchical clustering, you will definitely get the same clustering results.\n","\n","K-means require prior knowledge of K (number of clusters), whereas in hierarchical clustering we can stop at any level (clusters) we wish.\n","\n","\n","Hierarchical clustering is of two types:\n","\n","**Agglomerative**: This is a \"bottom up\" approach: each observation starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.\n","\n","**Divisive**: This is a \"top down\" approach: all observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively as one moves down the hierarchy.\n","\n","In this experiment we will use Agglomerative Clustering.\n","\n","A dendrogram is a tree like structure that shows the hierarchical relationship between objects. It is most commonly created as an output from hierarchical clustering. The main use of a dendrogram is to work out the best way to allocate objects to clusters.\n","\n","\n","Hierarchical clustering gives the deep insight of each step of converging different clusters and create dendrogram which helps you figure out which clusters combination makes sense and where you want to stop."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jHSeCQcxJRJr"},"source":["## Setup
